# We can enclose them with single or double quotes and assign them
# to variables. We can even combine strings by adding them (we call
# this concatenation).

print 'Hello'
print "Hello"

hello = "Howdy"
print hello

# Add your own code and notes here
# This code shows some basic variable assignment and string printing. 
name = "Andy"
print "Hello " + name
print name * 4

# This code shows the difference between the string "4" and the number 4.
# Remove the four comment characters (#) on the lines below to see what happens.
#print 4
#print "4"
#print 4 + 4
#print "4" + "4"

# This code shows some of the different mistakes that are easy to make while 
# working with string Remove one comment at a time and press Test Run to 
# see what happens
#print 'hello"
#print hello
#print "hello

# This code will give you a peek at what you are about to learn! Uncomment 
# all of the lines below to get a glimpse of "string indexing"
