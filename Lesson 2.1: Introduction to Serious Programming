# Lesson 2.1: Introduction to Serious Programming

# Programming is grounded in arithmetic, so it's important
# to know how programming languages do simple math.
# Thankfully, Python follows the same math rules people do.
# See if you can predict the output of this code.

# Write a Python program that prints out the number of minutes in seven weeks.
# Remember: 7 weeks 7 days in a week, 24 hours in a day, and 60 mins in an hour.
# Multiplying these numbers together will give you the result

# Write Python code to print out how far light travels 
# in centimeters in one nanosecond.  Use the values
# defined below.    
# speed_of_light = 299792458   meters per second
# centimeters = 100            one meter is 100 centimeters
# nanosecond = 1.0/1000000000  one billionth of a second
print 299792458.0 * 100 / 1.0/1000000000
print 299792458 * 100 / 1/1000000000
# Lesson 2.2: Variables

# Programmers use variables to represent values in their code.
# This makes code easier to read by telling others what values
# mean. It also makes code easier to write by cutting down on
# potentially complicated numbers that repeat in our code.

# We sometimes call numbers without a variable "magic numbers"
# It's best to reduce the amount of "magic numbers" in our code
